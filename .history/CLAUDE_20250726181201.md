## IMPORTANT: Sound Notification

After finishing responding to my request or running a command, run this command to notify me by sound:

```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
```

I'll make sure servers are running and reladed don't try to do it yourself.

## Important: linting

Before finishing make sure to run the linter

```node
npm run lint
```
